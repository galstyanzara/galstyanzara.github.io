        "description" : "Apples are sweetened, crunchy, and packed with fiber and vitamins, making them one of the most popular fruit snacks in the world. There are literally hundreds of varieties of edible apples and many different ways to eat them. Learn how to choose the best apples, store them, and pick up some fun ideas for eating them raw to cooked by reading this how-to. At the store, check to make sure that apples are firm to the touch and fragrant. A ripe apple should feel firm and should smell like an apple at the stem and at the blossom end. Some apples, like the Macintosh or the Jonathan, will feel slightly softer to the touch, because the flesh is somewhat mealier. That's perfectly fine. If they smell ripe, they are good to eat"
